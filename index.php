    <div><h1>Healthy Eating &Nutrition for Babies – birth to six months of age</h1></div>
    
    <span>Due to the body’s developing and disintegrating, rather than because of a winding time span. No matter what age one is at, the body goes through several remarkable changes that have an impact on their life in different ways. As a result, one must be aware of health guidelines as per age in order to serve family members and oneself towards a better life and health.
          <br>
We have different nutritional requirements at different stages of our lives. You must consider the extra demands that these changes make on your body in order to remain fit and healthy. It is possible to meet these basic requirements by eating fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, dairy products, and lean meats.

Healthy Eating Food for babies – six to 12 months of age</h1></div>
<span>Solid foods are recommended around six months of age to meet your baby’s growing nutritional and developmental requirements. Breastfeeding should be continued until the child is twelve months old or as long as the mother and child wish.
<br>It depends on society as to what food a baby should be given when starting to feed. Foods and preparation methods that are culturally appropriate and nutritionally adequate should be encouraged.
<br>With gradual weaning from the breast or bottle and introduction of new solids, a baby’s body iron stores may be reduced. Here are some tips to maintain nutrient at this stage:<br>
You should feed your baby iron-rich foods, such as iron-enriched cereals, pureed meats and poultry dishes, plain cooked tofu, as well as legumes/soy beans/lentils. Rice-based cereals enriched with iron are frequently suggested as the first food to be introduced, since they pose a lower risk of an allergic reaction.<br>
Food can be introduced in any order as long as the texture is appropriate to your baby’s developmental stage. Vitamins and minerals are found in fruits, vegetables, poultry, fish, and whole eggs.<br>
Your baby’s food should not contain salt, sugar, or honey. It is not necessary.
    Fruit juice should be avoided in favor of whole fruit. Drinks with added sugar should be avoided.
    Take away the bottle after your baby finishes drinking to prevent long-term exposure of their teeth to sugar-containing liquids.<br>
    To reduce choking risks, avoid whole nuts, seeds, and similar hard foods.
    One food at a time should be introduced. To avoid confusion and to eliminate any possibility of food allergy and sensitivity, introduce new foods every three to four days.

Healthy Eating for young children
</h1></div>
<span>
Once a child has started eating solids, offer a variety of foods to ensure adequate nutrition. It is important to encourage young children to eat a variety of foods, as they are often picky about food. A child may need to try new foods again before they accept them. They may need to try them eight to fifteen times before they accept them.<br>

The food intake of children (spontaneously) varies with their growth patterns throughout childhood. The food needs of children vary greatly according to their age and activity level. An increasing number of nutrients, vitamins, and minerals are required by children as they grow.<br>
As children approach adolescence, they should be accumulating stores of nutrients to prepare for this rapid growth spurt. Whether food intake is appropriate is determined by weight gain and development.<br>

In addition to overweight and obesity, children with food sensitivities and tooth decay also face food-related problems.<br>

The following recommendations are made:<br>
Eat nutrient-poor, energy-dense snacks if your child is gaining excessive weight. Encourage your child to become more active. Reduce your child’s television watching.<br>
Brushing your teeth regularly and visiting the dentist can prevent tooth decay. Steer clear of sticky or acidic foods and beverages.<br>
Water is especially important for your child. Juices and soft drinks should be limited.
    Reduced-fat milk should not be given to children under two due to their high growth rate and increased energy needs.<br>
    Peanuts, shellfish, and cow’s milk are some foods that trigger allergic reactions. You should be especially careful if you have a family history of food allergies.

Healthy Food for children entering their teenage years
</h1></div>
<span>        In adolescence, children need plenty of nutrients and calories during a growth spurt. Around age 10 to 11, girls generally experience a growth spurt. Boys generally experience one around the age of 12 to 13.
<br>
Recommendations include:<br>
In addition to supplying extra energy, foods should provide nutrients, not just ’empty calories’.
    The balance between takeaway and fast foods should include nutrient-rich foods such as wholegrains, legumes, nuts, vegetables, fish, and lean meats.<br>
    The consumption of milk, yoghurt, and cheese (mostly reduced fat) is important for calcium absorption – particularly for growing bones. Lower salt cheese is recommended.<br>
    The consumption of milk and milk products by adolescents should be encouraged.

     Healthy Food for Young Adults</h1></div>
     <span> When teens and young adults move away from home, start working or going to school, and change their lifestyles, their diets can change in ways that are not always beneficial for their health.

    <br>
    Recommendations include:<br>
    dations include:

    Engage in physical activity on a regular basis.<br>
    Dietary fats and salt should be reduced.<br>
    Be sure to include iron- and calcium-rich foods in your diet.<br>
    Maintain healthy eating habits throughout your life.
